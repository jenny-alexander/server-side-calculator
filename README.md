# Server Side Calculator

## Description

The objective of this stretch weekend challenge was to build a server-side calculator where the logic for the calculator had to be implemented on the server.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

In order to get the application up and running, do the following:

1. Download code locally from github.

2. Go to your terminal and type 'npm start'. This will start a local server on port 5000.

3. Go to your web browser and type 'localhost:5000'. This will bring up the calculator.

## Usage

1. Type a calculation into the calculator. This is done by typing one or more digits via the keypad, choosing an operator and then pressing the equal (=) button. For example, *3+9=*.

2. The answer will be displayed underneath the calculator and formatted as: *Answer: 27*.

3. The user can clear the console input by clicking on the clear button. The clear button is *C* on the calculator and is located next to the input screen.

4. Calculations will be added to a historical calculation list displayed under the answer.

5. The user can delete the calculation list by clicking on the *Clear Calculator History* button.
